This is an example for my question.md on github :https://github.com/magmagcup/somequiz/blob/master/teach.py

## Approach

* My approach:
For this question I store the data as a string in a list, Reason?. It look less confuser than list in list!


* Another approach #1:
1 string for all data.

* Another approach #2:
Store data as list in list.

* Another approach #3:
Oop

It have much *much* more approach than what I have mention above so I encourage you to try thinking for other approach
that I didn't not mention.

# Tip of the day
If your input have fix value use it, like for example in this question
We know that first input MUST have length = 4

So we could use that value as one of the condition to check if the input is correct or not
